"""referee.py -- the runtime half of the referee.  The author writes the file; this module
refuses the moves the author is not allowed to make.

WHY.  A file that both computes a result and announces whether the result came out is a file
in which the announcing party had an interest in the answer.  The failures this produces are
not lies; they are a verdict typed rather than computed, a prediction that failed with no
line saying so, and a withdrawal printed below the result it withdraws.  Each of those is the
author writing the referee's line.  This module makes those lines un-writable:

  declare(name, predicts=..., kills=..., requires=[...], control=..., budget=...)
      must precede verdict(name, ...).  A verdict with no declaration is refused.
      'predicts' and 'kills' are strings the run will be held to; 'requires' lists the
      existing results the claim leans on, by file and line; 'budget' records which
      formulation this is, out of how many.
  verdict(name, ok, detail)
      'ok' must be an EXPRESSION, not a literal -- the call site is parsed and
      `verdict("X", True, ...)` is refused.  The printed word is chosen by the value,
      never typed.
  control(name, ok, detail, vacuous=, rows=)
      a negative control: a case that MUST fail.  ok == True is a failure of the file,
      not a pass.  At least one is required before close().  `vacuous` states how many of
      the control's rows agree with the claim by construction and are therefore silent
      rather than failing; omitting it is recorded as NOT MEASURED so the omission is on
      the page.
  rows(name, violating)
      the rows behind a count.  A verdict whose 'ok' came from a count should call rows()
      with the offending items; close() lists sections that reported a number and no rows.
  withdraw(name, text)
      prints a withdrawal and refuses to run after a verdict for the same name has been
      printed -- withdrawals go above results.
  close()
      prints the ledger of declarations against outcomes and exits non-zero when any
      verdict lacked a declaration, no control ran, a control passed, or a prediction was
      contradicted without the file saying so.

Rows, not counts.  Predictions before runs.  The verdict is computed.
